        "If you want to try Georgian food in Paris it’s best option, there are all the traditional dishes, including vegan ones,  nice white wine, prices is quite good & stuff was very friendly.",
        "The food is ok. This is probably the best Georgian food you will find in Paris. The khinkali are not the best but there are no other options other than making them at home in Paris",
        "As a Georgian familiar with all the traditional dishes and flavors, I was disappointed with my experience at Pirosmani. While the Khachapuri was decent, the Kuchmachi dish completely missed the authentic Georgian taste I had hoped for. The use of chicken liver and tomatoes resulted in a completely different dish that was not enjoyable.For the main course, I ordered Kharcho, but was disappointed when the waiter informed me they served it with rice instead of Ghomi, a traditional pairing that is essential for this dish. The Kharcho itself also lacked the authentic flavor and was frankly disappointing Although the waiter was friendly, he did not speak Georgian, and I heard only Russian spoken in the kitchen. Overall, Pirosmani did not live up to my expectations of Georgian cuisine and lacked the authenticity I had hoped to find. A disappointment for anyone seeking genuine Georgian dishes.",
        "Traditional Georgian food in Paris. Welcoming owner and good food. Khinkali is definitely worth a try as well, the dough is a bit too thick..but still good flavours Only thing I would love to know is opening times posted or on Google.",
        "First time I tried Georgian food. Khachapouri bread is really good. Bortsch soup is worth the try (beetroot soup) and Tchanakhi (lamb stew with tomatoes, potatoes, etc) was excellent. The Ghalia is also really good (magret de canard on white rice)",
        "I was looking for a Georgian restaurant to let my fiancée taste this type of cuisine, since I have tried it several times in Moscow. This restaurant has served very well this purpose! The katchapuri was simply great, as well as the kinkhali and the chicken with a herbs creme. The Georgian soup was also good.Good quality over price ratio, there are several menus available, but the menu a la carte is affordable as well. I definitely recommend this restaurant, go there and try for yourself the authentic Georgian cuisine! Book in advance by calling or going there prior to your dinner.",
        "Great food and friendly atmosphere. Also, the prices are very reasonable. Too bad there aren't any vegetarian main dishes, however there are plenty of starters without meat.",
        "I was surprised by this place because I've never been to a Georgian. However, they serve food from many eastern places. The borscht was delicious. The place itself is very cosy and they play traditional music. I totally recommend it if you want to enjoy a good dinner!",
        "This was the first time I tried Georgian food and I really enjoyed it! The place was empty at that time, so we could really enjoy the restaurant for ourselves. We shared the khachapuri and the shkmerouli and they were amazing. The food was tasty, the staff was friendly and we could chat with them about their country, their traditions, their story in Paris, etc.We will definitely come back if we're ever back in Paris!",
        "Great French bistro! We had a lovely lunch, with a friendly quirky and fun waitress. We chose to sit inside as the patio was full and we love the interiors! Full of art and quirky bits and bobs. The duck was great, the melon salad SOO GOOD, with affordable wines and great olives.",
        "You must make a reservation! This place fills up quickly and most everyone has a reservation. We walked up on Saturday to make a reservation for Tuesday. We were seated promptly at our reserved time. It’s extremely busy and fast paced. The ratatouille was delicious, my steak was not overcooked, and very tender. The ravioli was too rich, my fiancé could barely eat it. There’s no English menu so do your research before showing up. The chocolat mousse is worth the hype - you must get it if you go.",
        "The food is really good. The ravioli and the mussels were exceptional, I would visit again just for these. The mousse is not overrated, it really is good. I wouldn't give them a five star because we didn't like the way we were treated by the blonde lady while being in the waiting list. it took us two hours to be seated. Tip: they don't have online reservation. You can call them in advance to reserve.",
        "Super cool place!! I guess we were a bit late for the lunchtime and couldn’t get the dish of the day. The chocolate mousse was so good!",
        "I had La Flottante and ratatouille. Both were very delicious, but I think ratatouille was my favorite, probably because I love eggplant. The olives served at the table before the meal were amazing. Despite the crowd and how busy it was, the waiter did their best to be attentive and even made some recommendations. Thank you for the lovely meal. The only thing that bothered me was being seated at the table near the entrance, as it was quite cold and I felt a bit chilly. However, since I was dining alone and didn’t have a reservation, it’s not something I can really complain about",
        "Ate here for the first night in Paris, Nicolas and Sammy were helpful with us being seated. The food was delicious however I wasn’t asked how I wanted the duck to be served- as a result it wasn’t cooked as much it would be. The entrecôte was chewy but the mousse is amazing. Unfortunately when we wanted to share the mousse, they didn’t give us plates. They only gave one, we were refused to be given a plate by 4 different staff, only to be given after asking a few times more, in a very unfriendly manner. It doesn’t make sense that you don’t give a plate? If you will go, I would go for the chocolate mousse.",
        "so good, and such a fun atmosphere.  the salad with cheese and prosciutto was delicious.  also any of the mains.  can’t go wrong with anything on menu.  great spot.",
        "Quite a disappointing experience. Came here because I heard great experiences from this place. However, the place is crowded and packed, mostly with tourists! You are cramped in spaces outside and inside. Staff are rude and curt, people who only want you in and out as fast as possible so they can seat the next table. The ratatouille was underwhelming. Good to say that you’ve tried this place, but there are far better experiences in Paris.",
        "I went to this place yesterday around 3pm. In order to have the dessert I was obliged to order one dish for me and one my husband (and it needed to be two, even after we have ordered two coffees and one melopepo). I would have understood if the place was full, but the moment we arrived there were 3 to 4 tables available. After sitting and order a coffee, I didnt want to get up and leave, what I should have done. Burrata was untaste, mussels + pesto combination caused me nauseas. When the chocolate mousse finally came I was feeling sick and it tasted beyond the sweetness it should. Indeed a good dessert, but notting spectacular. Don’t go to this place because of the dessert. It is not worthy and some patisserie’s in Paris have a similar mousse, like the Coutume (Coutume, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis, Paris, France). It should be ilegal to oblige the consumer to order some dishes in order to have others. This is tied sale! Otherwise, you should at least put an announcement mentioning your rules outside. And I am truly sorry you are a restaurant where the only good food you have is a dessert!",
        "Nasty encounter with a racist member of staff- I have been wanting to come here for years, my partner and I came here for lunch (3/9), 3:30pm, it was a great meal and the experience was very pleasant up until the end. It was completely spoilt however, by one of the waiters/FOH staff (tall white bald man) who approached my partner aggressively when we were going to the toilet after our meal. He was rude and hostile, “Where are you going, Normally you say bonjour before you use someone’s toilet, now you must ask me, may I use your toilet?” His attitude was racist, humiliating and nasty- he didn’t treat the other guests using the toilet the same and he was assuming we were not customers as we had come from dining outdoors, which says a lot about how he treats people. This was a very unpleasant encounter, and ruined our experience entirely. Never witnessed or had an experience like this before in any other city in the world. such a disappointing and quite frankly disgusting encounter, do better. No one should be made to feel this way, no excuse. Absolutely shocking behaviour! It is evident from past reviews this is a systemic issue here, I am disgusted by the attitude here quite frankly.",
        "This restaurant is a must in Paris. The BEST french food in town. Ah, dont miss their mousse."
